            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>To all Understanders or Lovers of MUSICK.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is easie to say I have been much importun'd, by Persons of Quality, to Publish my <hi>Compositions:</hi> But though I could plead it (and without vain Pretensions) yet now I shall wave it. Nor was I drawn to it by any little thoughts of private Gain; though men of my Relations (as the World now goes) are justly presum'd not to overflow; and perhaps the matter will not reach that value, let the <hi>Stationer</hi> look to that, who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath undergone the Charge and Trouble of the whole Impression; who yet (by his favour) hath lately made bold to print, in one Book, above twenty of my Songs, whereof I had no knowledge till his Book was in the Presse; and it seems he sound those so acceptable that he is ready for more. Therefore now the Question is not, whether or no my <hi>Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> shall be Publick, but whether they shall come forth from me, or from some other hand; and which of the two is likeliest to afford the true correct Copies, I leave others to judge. In this Book I reprint none that were publish'd in the former, or ever in print before. I could tell ye also, I have often found many of mine that have walkt abroad in other mens names: how they came to lose their Relations and be Anabaptiz'd, I think not worth examining. Only I shall say, that some who so adopted and owned my Songs had greater kindnesse for the Children than for the Father: else sure they had not bestow'd some other late Ayres (which themselves could not own) upon Forrainers and Strangers, because I <hi>compos'd</hi> them to <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> words. I should think such an Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an unseasonable piece of Injustice, since now we live in so sullen an Age, that our Profession it selfe hath lost its Incouragement. But Wise men have observ'd our Generation so giddy, that whatsoever is Native (be it never so excellent) must lose its taste, because themselves have lost theirs. For my part, I professe (and such as know me can bear me witnesse) I desire to render every man his due, whether Strangers or Natives. I acknowledge the <hi>Italians</hi> the greatest Masters of Musick, but yet not all. And (without depressing the Honour of other Countries) I may say our own Nation hath had and yet hath as able Musitians as any in <hi>Europe;</hi> and many now living (whose names I forbear) are excellent both for the Voyce and Instruments. But as in Musick the <hi>Unison</hi> and <hi>Diapason</hi> are the sweetest of all <hi>Chords,</hi> yet a <hi>Second</hi> and a <hi>Seventh,</hi> which stand next to them, are more <hi>Discordant</hi> from them than any other Notes in all the <hi>Scale:</hi> So to Musicians, a man's next Neighbour is the farthest from him, and none give so harsh a Report of the <hi>English</hi> as the <hi>English</hi> themselves. We should not think Musick any stranger to this Island, since our Ancestors tell us that the <hi>Britains</hi> had Musicians before they had Books; and the <hi>Romans</hi>

And since our palates are so much after Novelties, I desir'd to try the <hi>Greek,</hi> having never seen any thing <hi>Set</hi> in that Language by our own Musicians or Strangers; and (by <hi>Composing</hi> some of <hi>Anacreon's</hi> Odes) I found the Greek Tongue full as good as any for Musick, and in some particulars sweeter than the <hi>Latine,</hi> or these Moderne ones that descended from <hi>Latine.</hi> I never lov'd to <hi>Set</hi> or <hi>sing</hi> words which I do not understand; and where I cannot, I desir'd help of others who were able to interpret. But this present Generation is so sated with what's Native, that nothing takes their eare but what's sung in a Language which (commonly) they understand as little as they do the Musick. And to make them a little sensible of this ridiculous humour, I took a <hi>Table</hi> or <hi>Index</hi> of old <hi>Italian</hi> Songs (for one, two, and three Voyces) and this <hi>Index</hi> (which read together made a strange med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Non-sence) I set to a varyed Ayre, and gave out that it came from <hi>Italy,</hi> whereby it hath pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for a rare <hi>Italian Song.</hi> This very Song I have now here printed. And if this First Book shall find acceptance, I intend yearly to publish the like; for I confess I have a sufficient Stock lying by me (and shall compose more) having had the Honour to <hi>Set</hi> the Verses of the most and chiefest Poets of our Times. As for those Copies of Verses in this Book, I have rendred their Names who made them, from whose hands I received them. These Reasons (with some other not here mentioned) drew me forth to this Publication, which if receiv'd with the same heart that I offer it, will be further Encouragement for</p>

                  <l>But you can life to Verses give:</l>
                  <l>As when in open aire we blow</l>
                  <l>The breath (though strain'd) sounds flat and low,</l>
                  <l>But if a Trumpet take the blast,</l>
                  <l>It lifts it high, and makes it last:</l>
                  <l>So in your Ayres our Numbers drest</l>
                  <l>Make a shrill sally from the Brest</l>
                  <l>Of Nymphs, who singing what we pen'd,</l>
                  <l>Our Passions to themselves commend,</l>
                  <l>While Love Victorious with thy Art</l>
                  <l>Governs at once their Voyce and Heart.</l>
                  <l>You by the help of Tune and Time</l>

                  <l>For as a window thick with paint</l>
                  <l>Lets in a light but dim and faint,</l>
                  <l>So others with Division hide</l>
                  <l>The Light of Sense, the Poets Pride,</l>
                  <l>But you alone may truly boast</l>
                  <l>That not a syllable is lost;</l>
                  <l>The Writer's and the Setter's skill</l>
                  <l>At once the ravish't Eare do fill.</l>
                  <l>Let those which only warble long,</l>
                  <l>And gargle in their throats a Song,</l>
                  <l>Content themselves with <hi>Ut, re, mi,</hi>

But this is the Fate of all mankind, to be render'd less at home then abroad. For my part I can say (and there are will beleeve me) that if any man have low thoughts of mee hee is of my opinion.

And possibly this is it makes many of us hear so ill abroad; which works a Beleefe amongst our selves, that <hi>English words will not run well in Musick:</hi> this I have sayd and must ever avow, is one of the Errors of this Generation. I confesse I could wish that some of our words could spare a <hi>Consonant</hi> (which must not be stirr'd, for fear of removing those <hi>Landmarks</hi> in <hi>spelling</hi> which tell their <hi>Originall;</hi>) but those are very few, and seldome occur; and when they do, are manageable enough by giving each Syllable it's particular humour; provided the breath of the <hi>sense</hi> bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And (I speak it freely once for all) that if <hi>English</hi> words which are fitted for Song do not run smooth enough, tis the fault either of the <hi>Composer</hi> or <hi>Singer.</hi> Our <hi>English</hi> is so stor'd with plenty of <hi>Monosyllables</hi> (which like small stones fill up the chinks) that it hath great priviledge over divers of its Neighbours, and in some particulars (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence be it spoken) above the very <hi>Latin,</hi> which Language we find overcharg'd with the letter <hi>S,</hi> especially in <hi>has</hi> and such hissing <hi>Terminations.</hi> But our new <hi>Criticks</hi> lodge not the fault in our words only; tis the <hi>Artist</hi> they tax as a man unspirited for forraign delights: which vanity so spreads, that those our productions they please to like, must be born beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and fatherd upon strangers. And this is so notorious, that not long since some yong Gentlemen, who were not untraveld, hearing some Songs I had set to <hi>Italian words</hi> (publickly sung by <hi>excellent Voyces</hi>) concluded those <hi>Songs</hi> were begotten in <hi>Italy,</hi> and said (too loud) <hi>they would faine heare such Songs to bee made by an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish man.</hi> Had they layd their Sceane a little nearer home, there had beene more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; for a short <hi>Ayre</hi> of mine (neare 20 yeares old) was lately reviv'd in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nation, and publikely Sung to words of their owne as a new borne peece, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alteration of any one Note.

But there are knowing persons, who have beene long bred in those worthily admired parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> who ascribe more to us than wee to our selves; and able Musicians returning from Travaile doe wonder to see us so thirsty after Forraigners.
